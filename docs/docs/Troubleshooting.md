# Troubleshooting
## Folder with folder note still collapses
Issue: You've "Disable folder collapsing" enabled, click on a folder name that has folder note linked to it and it still collapses.

Possible cause & solution: You've "auto-reveal current file" enabled and need to disable it in order to make this feature work.
