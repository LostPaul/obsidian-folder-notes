### Open folder note

If you haven't changed any settings the simplest option is just to click on the name of a folder to open its folder note.

Use the context menu and instead of create click of open folder note. It only works with folders that also have a folder note and [if you don't know how to open the context menu click here.](#Create folder note)

The second option is to open one file of the files from the folder from which you want to open the folder note and then use the command "Open folder note of current folder of active note" from the [command palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette)

The last option and the option that is only available to desktop users is to use alt or ctrl and click on the folder name. When you don't hold ctrl/alt and click on a folder name the folder gets collapsed as normal. To use this option you first have to enable it in the plugin settings under the tab general.
