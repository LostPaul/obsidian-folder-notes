# File commands

## Create folder note
This command creates a new folder and uses the file you clicked on as the folder note. The new folder will be in the same folder as the folder the file was in.
## Turn into folder note for {folderName}
This command will attach the file to the folder it's in. For example file "test" that is in the folder "test2" will be the new folder note for the folder "test2".
