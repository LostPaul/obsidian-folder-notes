### Folder note name template
The entered text is going to be the name of all folder notes and when file name matches this text it becomes a folder note. {{folder_name}} is a placeholder for the name of the folder linked to the file. If you change the text every existing folder note which matched the old text won't be a folder note anymore and you have to use the button "Rename existing folder notes" to rename all folder notes.
