# Overview
Folder notes is a plugin for the note taking app  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that lets you attach notes to folders so that you can click on the name of a folder to open the note like in the app [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).
This plugin has some unique features that separate it from similar "Folder note" plugins like opening folder notes through the path, creating folder notes for every existing folder, templater/template support and more.
## Features
- Open folder notes through the file explorer/path by clicking on folder names
- Canvas folder notes (soon support for Excalidraw and more)
- Sync folder note name with the folder name
- Automatically create folder notes when creating folders
- Turn every folder into a folder note
- Folder overview code block with default settings in settings from the plugin
- Hide folder notes in the file explorer
- Underline folder names in the file explorer/path
- Stop collapsing of folders (with folder notes) in the file explorer
- Only open folder note through the folder name and the rest collapses the folder
- Front matter title plugin support
