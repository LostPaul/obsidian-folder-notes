# Overview
Folder Notes is a plugin for the note-taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that allows you to attach notes directly to folders. This lets you open a note by clicking on a folder name—similar to the functionality found in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).

Unlike other “folder note” plugins, Folder Notes offers several unique features, including support for custom file types, templating, and advanced folder handling options.

## Get started 

Read the [Getting started page](Getting%20started.md) for further details and the pages under the "Features" category explain every feature in detail.
## Features
- Open folder notes by clicking folder names in the file explorer or path
- Optional modifier key (Alt or Ctrl + click) to open folder notes
- Full support for any file type as folder notes (e.g., Excalidraw, Canvas, etc.)
- Automatically sync folder note names with their folder names
- Auto-create a folder note when a new folder is created
- Convert all existing folders into folder notes
- Use a folder-overview code block with configurable default settings
- Option to hide folder notes from the file explorer
- Style folder names (underline, bold, italic) in the file explorer or path
- Prevent automatic collapsing of folders that have folder notes
- Choose to only open the folder note when clicking the folder name; other clicks collapse the folder
- Front matter title plugin support
- Exclude specific folders using regex, path, or wildcard patterns (`*`)
