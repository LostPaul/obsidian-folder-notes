# Folder overview

This page will be updated soon and there also will be new features.

This feature/plugin creates a [code block](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#Code+blocks) that provides an overview of your entire vault or specific folders. Instructions for creating or editing a folder overview, along with additional guidance, can be found further down the page.
Currently there are two styles available: **file explorer** & **list style**, with more coming soon. The **overview updates** itself **automatically** when you create, delete or modify a file. You can also integrate it into **templates**, as explained further down below this page.

Additionally, you can **customize** the overview by selecting **specific file types**, adjusting **file depth**, and changing the **file order** (e.g., alphabetical: A-Z).
## Create overview 
There are two options to create a folder overview in a note

- Use the command "Insert folder overview" from the [command palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette)
- On desktop right click and click on the option "Create folder overview"
## Edit overview
If the overview shows no files or folders yet you can just click on the button that says "Edit overview". But if there are already files/folders it's a bit more complicated than the button and to then edit the overview you have to hover over the overview and click on the "Edit this block" button on the right top corner of the overview with only an icon.

The video below shows the steps explained in the text.

## Default settings
To edit the settings for a new folder overview that hasn't been created yet you have to open the plugin settings and go to the folder overview tab and click on the manage button.
