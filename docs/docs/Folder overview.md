# Folder overview
This feature/plugin creates a [code block](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#Code+blocks) that provides an overview of your entire vault or specific folders. Instructions for creating or editing a folder overview, along with additional guidance, can be found further down the page.
Currently there are two styles available: **file explorer** & **list style**, with more coming soon. The **overview updates** itself **automatically** when you create, delete or modify a file. You can also integrate it into **templates**, as explained further down below this page.

Additionally, you can **customize** the overview by selecting **specific file types**, adjusting **file depth**, and changing the **file order** (e.g., alphabetical: A-Z).
## Create overview 
There are two options to create a folder overview in a note

- Use the command "Insert folder overview" from the [command palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette)
- On desktop right click and click on the option "Create folder overview"
## Edit overview
If the overview shows no files or folders yet you can just click on the button that says "Edit overview". But if there are already files/folders you can use the command "Edit folder overview" from the [command palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette) or click on the button as showed in the video below.
